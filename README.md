# Olist Ecommerce Store Chain - Data Analysis and Visualization
This is project I have analyzed dataset of Olist Ecommerce stores. I have applied PowerBI, Python, SQL Server so that transformed Data and visualize this Data 

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize the Olist Ecommerce Store Chain dataset, obtained from Kaggle, using tools such as Power BI and MySQL. The dataset contains information about orders, customers, products, and sellers within the Olist Ecommerce platform.

## Technologies Used

- Power BI
- MySQL
- Python (for data preprocessing)

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle at the following link: [Olist Ecommerce Store Chain Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yourusername/olist-ecommerce-dataset).

## Data Transformation

The raw data required thorough cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency. Steps involved data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.

## Data Analysis

We conducted in-depth analysis on the Olist dataset, exploring various aspects of the e-commerce store chain. The analysis included customer behavior, order patterns, product trends, and seller performance.

## Data Visualization

We used Power BI and other visualization tools to create interactive and insightful visualizations. The visualizations showcase key findings and trends within the dataset.

## Conclusion

The analysis revealed interesting insights into customer behavior and product trends, which could potentially be used to optimize the performance of the Olist Ecommerce Store Chain. However, there are some limitations to the dataset and analysis, which are outlined in the conclusion.

## Folder Structure

- `/assets`: Contains the raw and processed datasets.
- `/`: Includes Python notebooks used for data preprocessing.
- `/visualizations`: Contains images and screenshots of the visualizations.

## How to Run the Project

1. Download the dataset from the Kaggle link provided above.
2. Install Power BI on your system (if not already installed).
3. Clone this repository to your local machine.
4. Execute the Python notebooks in the `/notebooks` directory for data preprocessing.
5. Open Power BI and load the cleaned dataset for analysis and visualization.
